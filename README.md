# My Machine Learning & Deep Learning Journey
Welcome to my repository where I document my journey in learning machine learning and deep learning. This is a space for me to track my progress, organize my notes, and build a personal cheat sheet for future reference.

üìöAbout This Repository  
In this repository, I will:

Document my learning progress step by step.
Create a cheat sheet summarizing key concepts and techniques.
Share and describe the projects I work on as I learn.
My goal is to gain basic knowledge in machine learning and deep learning, building a solid foundation for future work and study.

üõ†Ô∏èProjects  
Project 1: 01_pytorch_first_model.ipynb  
- Description:
  In this project I focused on creating my first model. The goal was to find the two variables 'weight' and 'bias' in linear function  
  y = weight * X + bias. To achive this I had to create data and based on them trained model to find correct value.   
- Step by step process:    
  * Import necessary libraries.  
  * Setup device-agnostic code.  
  * Create a straight line dataset using the linear regression formula (weight * X + bias).  
  * Split the data into training and testing.  
  * Plot the training and testing data.  
  * Build a PyTorch model by subclassing nn.Module.  
  * Create a loss function and optimizer using nn.L1Loss() and torch.optim.SGD(params, lr) respectively.  
  * Create training loop and testing loop.  
  * Saving model's state_dict() to file.  
  * Load this model back.
